//---------------------Game Requirements---------------------------

/*

Initial, basic animation of "Wordle" at the top of the page (<h1>);

Clear and obvious grid layout for the guessed words; 

A keyboard below the grid where player will click on letters for their guessed words; 
        An input window;
        A submit button;

A wordbank array that the app has access to in order to generate the hidden word 
        If a word that isn't in the wordbank array is chosen by the player, a message should appear telling them to try again;

Keys should make a sound when clicked; 
        Maybe a small animation when the cursor is placed over a key? 

When the key is clicked, the letter should appear in the input window; 

Once the 5-letter word is completed in the inout window, the player will be prompted to sumbit; 

Once submit button is clicked, the letters will appear cenetered in the first available row in the grid; 

If the word doesn't exist, a message will appear saying the work doesn't exist and the user should try a new word for submission; 

Once the word is in the row, each letter square will change color accordingly (see colors in "Game Description");
        In addition: the keys in the keyboard that corespond to the letters in the grid will change color;
        This will help players identify which letters shouldn't be selected again and which ones havent been played;

A "You Win!" message will appear if the player chooses the correct word by the final entry row; 
        Animate the screen with confetti or add animation to the "You Win!" message;
        A subsequent message will appear prompting the user to "Try again!" with a smiley face;
        A new button will appear allowing the user to reset the game and try again; 

A "You Lose!" message will apear if the player cannot guess the correct word by the final entry row;
        Animate with a sad, crying face;
        A subsequent message will appear prompting the user to "Try again!" with a smiley face;
        A new button will appear allowing the user to reset the game and try again; 

If the user clicks the "reset" button, all conditions will return to the starting point;
