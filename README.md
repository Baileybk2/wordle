## Welcome to wordle!

I chose this game because my favorite games to play are word games. I hadn't played wordle much before so I knew it would be a challenging opportunity to build the game.

[Planning Materials](https://github.com/Baileybk2/wordle/blob/main/planning_material.txt)

### Description

The goal of the game is to guess a mystery word before running out of chances. This game has 6 tries alotted to guess a 5-letter word. The word has been generated by program's word bank and is hidden from the user. Each time you submit a word, the tiles and keys will change color depending on the following criteria:

- Grey: the letter selected does not exist in the mystery word
- Yellow: the letter exists in the mystery word but it is out of place
- Green: the letter exists in the mstery word and is in the correct spot

The word bank in the data.js file was sourced from an online source (given below) and consists of 25 words or less per each letter of the alphabet. This word bank is much smaller than many other word games so not every correctly-spelled word the player submits will potentially work.

### Instructions

To start, simply click on the keys in the keyboard to create your first word. Once you have 5 letters, click the submit button and watch the tiles and keys change color based on the status of the letters.

> Note: if you submit a word that is spelled correctly and you are prompted to try another word, the word doesn't exist in the game's word bank. In this case the letters you clicked will clear from the tiles and you will recieve an error message prompting you to try another word; simple is better!

Using the colors of the tiles and the keys on the keyboard, you should choose the next word(s) accordingingly.

> Note: sometimes you may need to click on grey keys to create new words to try and continue to narrow down the mystery word.

Upon clicking submit by the final row, you will either receive a winning or losing message. You will also be prompted to reset the game by clicking the submit button.

You can receive a winning message earlier than the final row if you guess the word correctly sooner.

> Note: at any point in the game you can reset by clicking the reset button, however, a new word will be generated so only do this if you want to attempt another mystery word. You can reset as many times as you'd like.

### Planned Enhancements

A few features I'd like to add:

- A stop function and message after the player has typed their fifth letter telling them to submit before continuing

- A function that allows the player to backspace even after filling the entire row but before clicking submit (as of now they can backspace through their word but only before the final letter in the row is clicked).

- A function that won't update the key colors if a non-existent word is submitted (as of now the letters in the tiles dissappear and no color changes, but the keys still change color).

- An animated color gradient as the font color for the wordle title, to include the colors of the game

- screen confetti for a win

- a more extensive word bank
